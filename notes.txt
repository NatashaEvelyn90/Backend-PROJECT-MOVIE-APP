TODO: Creating a API movie project and will be pulling the information from SQL and using POSTMAN
TODO: Make sure you install packages: express, axios, mysql2, ejs, helmet, cors
TODO: make sure you have your required endpoints: actor, director, genre, movie, production and streaming_platform
TODO: When using POSTMAN, you will ONLY be using GET for now. POST will be later
TODO: make sure each endpoint(folders) will have 4 requests: findAll, findById, sor, and create your own~!
!: EJS is not needed to be used at this time
***************************************************************

!: This will be a step by step guide on what we need to do to create what needs to be done
?: Which info are we pulling? We are going to be pulling movie information that we previously created from a database in SQL. 

!:First Step: Run your command for initalizing json packages
    npm init -y

! Second step: Create your .gitignore file. Make sure to add the information in the file below
    ?- node_modules/
    ?- *-lock.json

! Third: We are going to have to install our packages. For this project, we are going to install the following:
    -npm i express axios mysql2 helmet cors ejs
    * Make sure you spell everything correctly or you could be installing a possible virus or malware onto your code!

? After we do that, lets go ahead and create some folders. 
    -First, lets create a "ROUTES" folder. 
    -Inside of that routes folder, make a router.js file. 
    ! Create a server.js file outside of the folders. (Can be called index.js or app.js)

? Once you have finished creating your folders, go to your package.json file and lets go and edit some information:
    TODO - Look for "main" and make sure you change it to server.js (or if you named it index.js or app.js)    
    TODO - In the "SCRIPTS" section at the end, put a comma at the end of the 1 and then add these as follows:
        "start": "node server.js",
        "dev": "nodemon server.js"
        ! - if you named it something other than server, make sure it matches everywhere so these would have to say the same as your file. So those sever.js I listed at the end of node and nodemon they have to match what you named your file. 
    TODO - Next, you can go to the author section and add yourself as an author. Everything else can be left alone. 
? Once you have completed that, it is time to create our first pages!!

********************************************************

! First, go to server.js and we are going to start our server.
    TODO - Follow Steps One and Two
        ? - Whenever you are creating your server.js (app.js or index.js) Step 1 and Step 2 are the first ones you have to create as that is the building block of your server. 
        * - You can check to make sure that your server is running by going to your terminal and typing in `npm run dev`
        * - If you are able to see your console.log that you created showing up in your terminalthen that let's you know that your terminal is reading and listening to the port that you have created.
    TODO - Go ahead and upload to Github and that is your first saving point after step 1 and 2 !  
! Next, we are going to add our security files to kind of keep our webpage safe
    ? That means, you would need to have to add helmet and cors code to your server.js documentation. Follow step 3 instructions    

! After creating the security with cors and helmet, we have to create a connection to our database (our SQL database). However, we do not want to expose our password that we had created for SQL. So we are going to have to create a folder to keep our information in
    TODO - Create a "CONFIG" folder and then inside that folder create a dbconfig.js file
        * - go to .gitignore and put "config/dbconfig.js" into the file on a separate line. The reason the gitignore file exists is that when you upload this file to github, people won't be able to read those particular files. ONLY YOU will be able to read them.

! Head back to your server.js file and make sure you follow Step 4.
    ? - If you had your file running, meaning you did a npm run dev in your terminal, you should be receiving a error that states "TypeError: argument handler must be a function." That is normal. The error means that we have imported it but we haven't exported it. (Also at this time, we do not have anything listed/written within the router.js file). 
! To fix this error, head to router.js and follow the steps listed. Once you add Step 1, the error disappears and the server runs again. (you should still see your sentence you created. For this project, I used 'It's time to go to the movies!') 

! After your server is fixed, Its time to start creating the root router. Follow to step 2
    ? - The root route is what I understand like a homepage and where you will be be later designing a main hub. You should be able to create individual links of your future-linking of "tables"?? or something similar like so.

    ? - After creating your root route, you will be going to create an error page. It will be a temp error page as we will be putting the design aspect on it at a later time.

    Once you refresh the page, it should show a link!!! It should show what you have created!!! WELL DONE! If you click on it, it won't work and it will bring you to your error page. GOOD WORK! 
        TODO: Go ahead and push your work to Github so that it is saved

! Next we are going to be building a network of Data Access Objects also known as DAOs. This will help our database we built (SQL) talk with our website we are trying to build. 
    TODO - So we are going to have to build a folder called "daos". 
    TODO - Inside the daos folder, create a file called daoCommon.js. This is going to be a file that handles most of the leg work for us. Not necessarly a helper file but a main component that will link our SQL database file to our project. 

! After creating your findAll within your daoCommon.js file, go ahead and create another folder within your daos folder called "common" and move your daoCommons.js file into it. Allow it to move and if it asks to update anything, say yes. 

! Next, create ANOTHER folder within the daos folder called "api". Once you finish doing that, create a file called movieDao.js and add that to the api folder.

! Finally, create a dao.js file that sits freely in the daos folder. (it does not sit in the api or the common folder in the daos community)
    *Each of the files has a common goal or reason on what they have to do. For example:
        ? daoCommon.js = A file we created that has general code. It is to be used to help ALL tables and not just a specific one. Kind of like Public wifi that everyone can use. 

        ? movieDao.js = This file is strictly only for the movie table we created back in SQL. Any information we type up is only for dealing with this table. So if we need to change or update something in here, it will ONLY affect this table. Consider this private wifi.
            ! You will have multiple files in this category for your other tables
    
        ? dao.js = This is the file that is supposed to link the tables and information together. All the daos will be meeting here. the main hubspot.
    
! After writing code in your dao.js file, create a api folder inside your routes folder. Inside that api folder, create a movieRoutes.js file. Follow the instructions in there.
    TODO - CONGRATS! YOU REACHED A CHECKPOINT! UPLOAD TO GITHUB!
